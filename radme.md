# features dimension

### same as og

Key Issues:
Inconsistent MFCC Parameters: Your mfcc function ignores the passed frame_length and hop_length, using librosa's defaults instead. This causes mismatches with other features.

Feature Dimensions: The current stacking (np.hstack) flattens all features into a 1D vector, which isn't suitable for Conv1D (expects 2D input: [timesteps, features]).

Augmentation Handling: Augmented features are stacked vertically, creating multiple samples per file, but the original feature extraction doesn't preserve the time-axis structure.
